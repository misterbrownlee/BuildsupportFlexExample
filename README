Flex Example for Build Support 

README

Usage:
This is an example Flex project, designed to be used with the https://github.com/tehfoo/buildsupport repository.
The build.xml file has been written to utilize the importable tasks from buildsupport, providing an example
of how quickly a standard flex project can implement Ant based build tasks.

Installation:
YOU MUST REFERENCE THE BUIDSUPPORT LIBRARY PROJECT AT THE ROOT LEVEL OF THIS EXAMPLE.

How:
1) clone buildsupport into the project root
1a) to ease use on multiple projects, clone to a tools directory, and symlink into your project root
2) copy buildsupport/example.build.properties to <project-root}/build/, rename build.properties
3) modify build.properties to represent your local settings
4) run ant -projecthelp to see what tasks are available
5) run any of the ant tasks you would like, and see the results in <project-root/build/output


Assumption:
Most projects follow a simple pattern of a base directory, with source in an src folder, libraries in a libs
folder, and no drama.  If that's the case, you can set project.dir and flex.home.dir properties, and you 
should be all set.  If your project's structure is different (more complex), you will probably need to create more 
specific ant targets or provide custom compiler configuration to make this all work.
